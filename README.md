## Overview

This is a monorepository for my home Kubernetes cluster.
I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/),  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

The purpose here is to learn Kubernetes, while practicing GitOps. I have two longer-term goals:

1. migrate many of the services that I currently run on different raspberry pi's or servers around the house into a single, congruous k8s environment
2.

## ⛵ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is built using [k3s](https://k3s.io/), provisioned on bare-metal debian Linux using the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s). This is a hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes. I also have a separate NAS server with ZFS for NFS shares, bulk file storage and backups.

## Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): self-hosted Github runners
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Configured to create TLS certs for all ingress services automatically using LetsEncrypt.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): monitors service and ingress resources, and automatically generates DNS updates for them. This lets me maintain DNS mappings and LetsEncrypt certificates without a cloudflare account or domain.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password](https://1password.com/).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform which are committed to Git

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes
├── 📁 apps           # applications
├── 📁 bootstrap      # bootstrap procedures
├── 📁 flux           # core flux configuration
└── 📁 templates      # re-useable components
```

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.

## 🌐 DNS

### Home DNS

In cluster I run [blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) deployed. In my cluster `external-dns` is deployed with the `RFC2136` provider which syncs DNS records to. `blocky` is used by non-servers as ad-blocking and caching proxy.

### Public DNS

The `external-dns` instance mentioned above another instance is deployed in my cluster and configured to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingress this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an ingress class name of `external` and contain an ingress annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.

## 🔧 Hardware

### Main Kubernetes Cluster

| Node                | CPU               |  RAM | Storage    | Function             | OS         |
|---------------------|-------------------|------|------------|----------------------|------------|
| CM3588 | Quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 and quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU    | 16GB | 4* 4 Tib SSD  | control-plane        | Debian |
| RPI4 | Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72     | 8GB | 240GB SSD  | control-plane        | Debian |
| RPI5 | Quad-core ARM Cortex-A76   | 8GB | 240GB SSD  | control-plane        | Debian |

I fully intend to replace the raspberry pis with something with a little more oompfh at some point in the future, perhaps more cm3588's, perhaps something else.

#### note: custom kernel

For the raspberry pis to get cilium-envoy working, we compile a custom kernel that has CONFIG_PG_TABLE_LEVELS set to 4

```bash
apt install -y git bc bison flex libssl-dev make libncurses5-dev
cd /opt
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
cd linux

# create kernel config
#RASPI 4: `make bcm2711_defconfig`
#RASPI 5: `make bcm2712_defconfig`

# # DO OTHER TUNINGS HERE via `make menuconfig`

cd /opt/linux
cat > .config-fragment << EOF
CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS_48=y
EOF
./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh .config .config-fragment
make -j4 Image.gz modules dtbs
make modules_install

cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb /boot/
cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
# RASPI 4: cp arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz /boot/kernel8.img
# RASPI 5: cp arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz /boot/firmware/kernel8.img
echo "kernel=kernel8.img" | tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt
reboot
```

for the cm3588 I had to do a similar thing:

```bash
apt install -y git bc bison flex libssl-dev make libncurses5-dev
cd /opt
git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.collabora.com/hardware-enablement/rockchip-3588/linux.git
cd linux

export ARCH=arm64
make defconfig
cd /opt/linux
cat > .config-fragment << EOF
CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS_48=y
EOF
./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh .config .config-fragment
make -j4 Image.gz modules dtbs
make modules_install
reboot
```
